      You are an impartial evaluator. You will be given two movie review, Review 1 and Review 2.
      Your task is to decide which response expresses a more positive attitude, tone, or sentiment.

      After analyzing both responses, choose the one that is overall **more positive**.

      Review 1:
      {generated1}

      Review 2:
      {generated2}

      FIRST provide a one-sentence comparison of the two reviews, explaining which is more positive and why. SECOND, on a new line, state only "1" or "2" to indicate your choice. Your response should use the format:
      Comparison: <one-sentence comparison and explanation>
      Preferred: <"1" or "2">
    preference_pattern: "Preferred:\\s*[\"']?([12])[\"']?"
