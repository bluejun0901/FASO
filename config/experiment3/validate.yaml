      prompt: |
        You are an impartial evaluator. You will be given two movie review, Review 1 and Review 2.
        Your task is to decide which response expresses a more positive attitude, tone, or sentiment.

        After analyzing both responses, choose the one that is overall **more positive**.

        Review 1:
        {generated1}

        Review 2:
        {generated2}

        FIRST provide a one-sentence comparison of the two reviews, explaining which is more positive and why. SECOND, on a new line, state only "1" or "2" to indicate your choice. Your response should use the format:
        Comparison: <one-sentence comparison and explanation>
        Preferred: <"1" or "2">
      preference_pattern: "Preferred:\\s*[\"']?([12])[\"']?"
