       "\"<s> Tens of thousands of comic book fans decked out in fancy dress gathered in London today for one of the UK's biggest celebration of animated culture. The London Super Comic Book Convention, which kicked off last today, saw fans donning elaborate and often skimpy costumes in homage to their comic book favourites. Comic super-fan and television presenter Jonathan Ross was among the celebrity guests for day one alongside Storage Wars' Sean Kelly and John Romita Junior- son of comic book legend by the same name- who draws for DC comics. There were a number of tributes to Guardians of the Galaxy's tree-like character Groot and characters from the Lego Movie. Among the best-dressed were also a trio who posed as Batman and his nemeses the Joker and Harley Quinn. A total of 25,000 fans are expected to pay the Excel Centre, in east London, a visit over the course of the event, which lasts until tomorrow. The annual event, now in its four year, is the biggest comic book themed event in the UK, and the third for pop culture. One of the event organisers, Gary Morris, said: 'It's been an incredible first day. The atmosphere has been amazing and the level of costumes has been out of this world. 'People have really brought their A-game this year. 'The market for these sort of events is definitely growing. Just look at the films which are in the box office at the moment- they're all based on comic books. We like to look at the heritage that led to that.'

      "(CNN)First, the women. Now, the men. It seems everyone is getting in on the \"Ghostbusters\" reboot action. But not everyone is happy about it. Deadline reports that Sony Pictures is planning an all-male \"Ghostbusters\" reboot starring Channing Tatum and directed and produced by brothers Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. The studio is also creating a production company, Ghostcorps, which will include Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd, who were among the original \"Ghostbusters\" team, according to Deadline. \"We want to expand the Ghostbusters universe in ways that will include different films, TV shows, merchandise, all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment,\" Deadline quoted Reitman as saying. The film \"has a wonderful idea that builds\" on the premise of an all-female \"Ghostbusters\" reboot expected to begin filming this summer. That film is expected to star Melissa McCarthy,  Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. \"It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies,\" Deadline quoted Reitman as saying. All well and good. \"Ghostbusters\" is, after all, a well-loved comedy classic that gave the world the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. But the news, close on the heels the much-lauded all-female \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, has met with mixed reviews. \"Couldn't u just let the girls have this one ONE FREAKING TIME?\" Twitter user jessieroro13 posted. Others think perhaps it's time to derail the Hollywood reboot train, no matter which gender is in the driver's seat. \"How about no #Ghostbusters reboots, redos or remakes,\" Twitter user EA_Creative wrote. \"Why mess with perfection?\" The all-female \"Ghostbusters\" film is expected to be out next year. All all-male version is tentatively expected to begin filming in the summer of 2016, to be released the following year, Reitman told Deadline.\n",

      "A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .\n",

      "Leela, I want to believe the story was about this very strong-head, stubborn, independent, no-nonsense kind of woman, that has a man who loves him, but for his stubborn and no-convention self, who won't do what's expected, not what's common, he starts feeling frustrated. He, because this time things couldn't happen in a \"straightforward way\", so his new girlfriend comes in between of everything. After he decides to go for some action and that's one hell of a powerful, funny and beautiful love story between two people who should be different with the rest of the world and yet love it anyway for each other to get where they really are at, when they fall in love and it doesn't happen like the expected or the easiest one ever in life, which has been their lives together until this day, despite how much things had been shaking their world.  A great performances by all cast, a beautiful script, well written characters with no one was a stranger, excellent costumes, super quality cinematography, excellent soundtrack, good sound direction ... a beautiful movie, well produced, and worth watching, recommended.  I give this movie 9 out of 10, and don't you forget what my mom always told me: If you can say good-bye, just say good-bye. Now it's time to start the happy ending with Leela and her lover, and all those beautiful children which come from this little love between two people at its best, who made me cry, laugh, cry a lot more the last time I saw it.  Thanks for an excellent movie with wonderful, beautiful performances! \n",

      "> Iftekhar Murtaza, one of the defendants, admitted today that he \"kicked off the whole thing with Jayprakash Dhanak who he thought would eventually find Karishma of his choice.\" Murtaza is seen to be a bit on top of Shayona, who has given him \"a little tug on her sleeve\". The night he was picked up for their marriage, Murtaza had been to see the film \"Inside Out - India\" which \"a lot of the time is an overly complicated narrative about a few simple things. I loved Shayona Dhanak; but in an instant, I realized he has the kind nature of the woman with whom I have fallen deeply in love.\" The picture \"Ishta\" - Shayona in another persona- comes across as \"a bit mystical as Shayona is about it . This is in spite of the violence involved... This beautiful piece gives the viewer a different experience\". Shayona says: \"Very real images in an otherwise mystical, mysterious world of my very, very true art in a way it has to be. It reminded me of our love... I am glad its not a movie I am reviewing, more a true love story about 2 people with a deeper connection than a movie that makes a huge impression on your emotions in every direction ... and you feel your way to that\". We wish if, Murtaza, his wife and son survived this ordeal... May we and Shayona's story have a happy ending. \"Kashi\" is his film and though one critic might say Murtaza is being too philosophical. He did get much \"Philosophy for you\". But if some may complain on not making a political movie. Anyway, a compendium is still compendium after all even some \"philosohical\" one. So, all is good \"Ishto\", for me, to have enjoyed a very beautiful film \"Ishto Phadon Mistu Kadhamo, Mardokom Mehtu Nigamko and then made this into a movie with music by my man...\" And in fact that is the very music of the film too. But it was worth all for me. The movie makes you reflect on a love that was so strong but one that is not \n",

Bloodily in that awful death a lot of blood had shown her face along her upper left chest ... ... In the photo you see a large body that is the same one they later would use to dismember another poor unsuspecting woman that Murtaza wanted, later used a shark to do another job, and also uses in the killing of Karishma ...  In short the picture of the murder of Jayprakash is very striking especially the image which we see the woman trying to look on Jayprakash and make a bid of help and what would be left when the knife was sharpened into his flesh ...   Well ... this was rather a disturbing view which took place in full day light with the sky light to day and everything was in place for a scene that could have been done in front of camera .  Now you could have more on the way Murtaza \"picked\" his first woman for this sad task ... and when I say sad the fact this is he has a knife of a nice lady's hand which he pulls back out . You have no idea how well crafted the scene is and how quickly his hands begin their work ...  The shot of Murtaza trying and trying again to reach into the very bottom of her dress which the body seems clamoring for her blood so he tries again to get the very bottom of her garment .... in other words the woman is in full on \"Love Strife\"   It was interesting how he made it pretty clear what he would be doing the minute the door was slightly opened and we could already feel the urgency in that scene ... I loved the fact he \"flicks\" the camera right over this point after her body has literally been plucked from within ... so clever ...   Very well crafted though that scene ... the best and the bravest ...  But of course as much as they put all the guns to her side as well (as Murtaza tries to get at and kill a rather naïve new man from his first and third date ...)

Authorities in Orange County, California, said he died when the wife turned his knife on him in one of his many failed efforts to win over their elder daughter, with whom her husband had been having an affair. The young couple lived on a hill overlooking a park, where she'd once discovered a flower bed once owned by her stepfather, who was later stabbed several times. Killer: Leela Dhanak saw her husband being \"screaming\" at her ex-husband about reconciliation and their kids in trouble in the \"bush.\" But she did not want to let him change her life or live again as he would be a farmer and a boring husband and father ... Too early to make an assessment of the movie since I still sleep on the story: \"It begins in a sleepy neighborhood and follows it's course with the kind of music that gets you thinking...I love it!

      "Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto. Patriotic: Harry chats to a member of the army - he announced this week he will quit the army in the summer . Pointing the way: The Prince is an avid rugby fan - England and Wales host the World Cup later this year . Suave: Harry, in a sharp navy suit, walks along the side of the hallowed Twickenham turf before the match . The Six Nations is the last competitive rugby tournament before England host the World Cup later this year. The tournament begins on September 18 with England taking on Fiji at Twickenham. In 2014 Prince Harry was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which aims to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019. Looking up: Prince Harry takes his seat in the stands with Bernard Lapasset, left, chairman of the IRB . Role model: Harry chats to students from Reigate School, who had played before England's match vs France . Charismatic: The Prince - patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, jokes with the girls before a photo shoot . He is also Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation. Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.\n",

      "Prince Harry is a keen rugby lover. His love has been sparked while travelling on official royal tours for business - to New Zealand, South Africa and South Africa; it has been confirmed in official documents seen by the world's press which have noted the prince's 'great personal love of rugby' which has been fostered by his travels across the world, leading his fellow royals to travel to some places he hasn't heard even of yet. This affection has seen Prince Harry show his support, often dressed in an armband that displays the emblem of the British, a flag that embodies their 'Royal Foundation' and 'RFU Foundation' which he has proudly carried to each match they take part in, in front of the players. This love for rugby shows his support in making the world a bit happier knowing all nations are on the same page. The Prince has come out as a Rugby Union fanatic and you can hear that in the soundtrack during matches. However, one thing that is clear, when the rugby matches have passed, like in recent world cup contests, Harry makes no secret about wanting more international rugby. Although Harry has stated his 'strong belief' in the team taking part in Rugby World Cup in the future, something it seemed he did, it hasn't yet been confirmed whether in fact, England have finally taken part. When the rugby was on, Prince Harry was often a great inspiration to his younger male royals. He encourages his young fellow boys to take to rugby for its many benefits to youth development (as well as team spirit) and is keen to try out the sport in as large a way as possible in the UK and other locations it operates. Harry may have changed countries on a few occasions since he embarked on official duties and this has meant he has lost some of his British passports but he may be emboldened in that he can now apply for all countries' newborn passports with 'Prince Of Wales and Camilla Prince Of Scotland's Own' embroidered across it and therefore the world can call him Harry Prince of Wales and the rest is of British Commonwealth. However, he would like to see the rugby spread its wings in South East Asia, his homeland that would be of a special interest to him to develop and improve his skills, along with being a part of their future too. \n",

      "The Prince of Wales visited rugby team at the Twickenham training camp last night as he is backing Wales coach Stuart Lancaster to win the prestigious Grand Slider - an honour to become World Champion rugby nation with the most points accumulated in a year's time after securing a bonus on this side.  The team's first home rugby match will also celebrate the one year anniversary of the Grand Slider becoming one. When asked about how his mother's death will influence his team, the second oldest brother, The Prince of Wales, replied: 'My mother had three girls, and one of her younger brothers is a rugby coach with the team as well so she is a rugby supporter herself'. Although some teams have won the Grand Slider before (the team were runner-up in 2015 - a historic win against Scotland at Cardiff) it has previously been won 27 times. However this year's contest will see the Welsh and English teams facing one another at Newlands against a South African side based at Easter Club rugby. The team was put in as hosts and at their core a Wales team that includes one Wales star on the South African side and no English but the best and brightest Welsh side in decades and also includes many top performers who are coming up against their rivals who have more years of European Rugby Club rugby played in but no success with their nations (a French born Scottish who coached Scotland's European win in 2015, South African player from an almost non contact Rugby School in their capital city as most of the squad are local boys and with no Welshman born in a Welsh speaking community involved). The match also celebrates the two countries 'civil wars' a year ago over Scotland's recent independence, with the Wales team's win over English at the Grand Slider. There will also be a celebration for the second weekend match, which England will take on New Zealand, where they have won two, against the likes of Australia and South Africa that England struggles most with - as this team from London can find a good lineout anywhere but often find the try line on home soil - it was great to think that it may be an English rugby home for a generation yet for an England first victory in a home rugby ground since the Millfield Cup win in 1980 was 'something' - \n",

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch'. Although not always my preferred form of rugby (I generally prefer physicality!) this match was certainly the more gripping and dramatic game for England fans amongst rugby lovers all around the world. The French had not fared too badly throughout the round and were, as was usually the case with England when they get the better of them, at best playing good rugby. Still it was not until after a number of penalties on England with just a hand over a few metres outside the French area, and England were already trailing 34-10 in their last match, did the French begin to gain some footing to win it. A good kick outside the area and a late penalty to put it 35-20 at half time was then scored that would ultimately see them leave with the trophy, while England fell just short once more as history showed how rugby is best at delivering memorable moments from unexpected places! However, their victory underlines the excellent performances throughout the tournament that saw England defeat Italy after a very dramatic penalty count in their second-last tie while Italy won the battle of attrition but fell at Wembley on England-France in spite. And in their final tussle a very nervous-looking Wales produced a sparkly display to earn a deserved draw against eventual Champions USA, while scrapes against a well-trained Welsh side saw Australia and Ireland win narrow and thrilling contests to secure the Grand Slam. \n",
