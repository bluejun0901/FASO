      "A U.S. Consumer Advisory Group set up by the Department of Transportation has raised concerns about the shrinking space on aeroplanes, particularly for passengers. The group, which was formed by the Department of Transportation in response to a consumer complaint, has recommended that the government set minimum standards for the amount of space available for humans. The group's report highlights the issue of crowding on planes, which could lead to more serious health and safety concerns for passengers. The group's report suggests that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it does not stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans.

The group's report also highlights the issue of seat pitch, which refers to the distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it. Some airlines have reduced seat pitch, while others have increased it.
