      "Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage to the brain well into adulthood, a new study has warned. This is because drinking excessive amounts of alcohol when young can damage the brain and cause permanent changes to DNA. This, in turn, can put teenagers at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism, researchers found. Alcohol changes genes in brain cells, which stop the cells developing connections between them, altering behaviour, they said. However, they discovered a cancer drug may reverse the damage. Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage into adulthood, putting young people at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism . Professor Subhash Pandey, of the University of Illinois College of Medicine, explained that binge drinking during the teenage years disrupts the brain's normal development. He said: 'Our study provides a mechanism for how binge-drinking during adolescence may lead to lasting changes that result in increased anxiety and alcoholism in adults.' Intermittent alcohol exposure 'degrades the ability of the brain to form the connections it needs to during adolescence, he explained. 'The brain doesn't develop as it should, and there are lasting behavioural changes associated with this,' he added. As part of the study, Professor Pandey and his team carried out lab experiments on 28-day-old rats to investigate how alcohol would affect their brain development. They were given alcohol for two days on, then two days off, which was repeated over 13 days. Rats exposed to alcohol showed changes in behaviour that lasted into adulthood, long after the exposure to alcohol ended. Alcohol causes changes in the DNA in brain cells. However, researchers discovered a cancer drug may be able to reverse the changes . They showed increased anxiety-like behaviours and drank more alcohol in adulthood. When brain tissue from the area of the brain called the amygdala was examined, rats given alcohol showed changes to their DNA, known as epigenetic changes. Professor Pandey explained that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of DNA, or of the proteins around which DNA is wound, like thread on a spool. Modification of these proteins, which are called histones, can change how loosely or tightly the DNA is wound. Many of us enjoy a chilled glass of wine or a cold beer after a hard day at work. But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. Genes that lie within DNA that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than if the DNA is loosely wrapped. The looser the DNA is coiled, the more accessible the genes are to the cellular machinery that 'expresses' them. The rats exposed to alcohol had more tightly coiled DNA. They also had increased levels of a protein called HDAC2, which modifies histones, causing DNA to be wound tighter around them. These epigenetic changes were linked to lowered expression of a gene that nerve cells need in order to form new connections between cells, known as synaptic connections. Professor Pandey argued the lowered activity of this gene may be due to the tighter winding of its DNA. The lower activity of the gene persisted in adulthood, even if alcohol exposure was stopped weeks before. The researchers also observed diminished connectivity between nerves in the amygdalae of these affected adult rats. But a cancer drug known to block the activity of HDAC2 could be used to treat them, he said. In his experiments, the drug restored expression of the gene needed for synapse formation and the rats' DNA was observed to be less tightly coiled. The effect of this was that the rats exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake. Professor Pandey added: 'We aren't sure if the drug needs to be given long term during adulthood in order to completely reverse the harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.' The findings were reported online in the journal Neurobiology of Disease.\n",

      "The changes mean connections do not form as normal between the cells .\n",
      "This alters the way genes are expressed and changes behaviour .\n",

      "Christian Benteke rescued Aston Villa from the drop zone with a brilliant late free-kick to seal his hat-trick and salvage a point against relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. Tim Sherwood’s team were set to drop into the bottom three when Charlie Austin scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season 12 minutes from the end, before Benteke’s intervention five minutes later to cap off a pulsating game. The point lifts QPR above Burnley to 18th on goal difference, while Villa move above Hull to 16th. Tim Sherwood was disappointed that Aston Villa's domination of QPR did not result in three points for his side . Sherwood did concede that the point taken could be vital and praised Christian Benteke for his hat-trick . Sherwood said: ‘I’m disappointed with a point when we’ve dominated the match like that. The referee should have stopped it at half-time. Anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn’t have been close. ‘But it’s not about what you deserve, it’s about what you actually get. This could be a vital point come the end of the season. When you’re going so late into the game and Christian’s had to pull that one out of the bag, we’re grateful for that.’ Chris Ramsey was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from Villa Park, having twice led, initially through Matt Phillips’ header. Benteke equalised with a deflected shot before putting Villa ahead before the break with a cool finish. Defender Clint Hill levelled the game with a header before Austin struck and Benteke scored his seventh goal in five Villa games to ensure honours finished even. Benteke was Villa's star man, twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at Villa Park . Charlie Austin had scored late on for QPR as they looked to claim and unlikely away end in the Midlands . Ramsey praised Benteke, saying: ‘He is a formidable player. When you are playing against people that can pull out that little bit of magic, sometimes you have to hold your hands up. His free-kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper, who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it.’ The QPR head coach added: ‘Based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you haven’t been able to get above the line, which was the aim before we started the last two games. We showed tonight we’re more than capable of doing that. I don’t know what we need but we’re probably going to have to win three games. We know our next home games will be very important. We have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last game of the season. QPR head coach Chris Ramsey called Benteke a 'formidable player' after he took apart the visitors . Sherwood and Ramsey embrace before kick-off having spent periods of their careers working together . ‘Any team would take being in it right till the end and then roll the dice. You don’t want to become detached where every game is a mountain to climb. There is a belief in the camp they are capable of surviving, there is no doom and gloom.’ Sherwood added: ‘We’re creating chances, aren’t we? I can’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before I came in, incredible really for players with that kind of strike-rate... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back. Otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble.’ Sherwood now takes his team to Tottenham and Manchester City. ‘Who is to say we can’t go to any of those games and win?’ he said. ‘We’ll try. We can’t do what QPR have done today, we’ll play on the front foot.’ .\n",

Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga.
